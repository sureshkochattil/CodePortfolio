## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We will first invoke all the required libraries 
library(tidyverse)  # data manipulation
library(cluster)    # clustering algorithms
library(factoextra) # clustering algorithms & visualization
```

## We will calculate the distance based on both Euclidean and Manhattan methods

```{r}
# calculating the distances
vector1 <- c(5,2,1,4)
vector2 <- c(5,5,4,2)
matrix12 <- matrix(c(vector1,vector2), byrow=T,nrow=2)
dist(matrix12, method="manhattan")
dist(matrix12, method="euclidean")
```
